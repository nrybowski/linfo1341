    - The port 1 is not designated; The port 2 is not blocked. All ports on the root
        switch are in the designated state. For the other switches, the port with
        the best incoming BPDU is in a root state. The other ports are either designated
        or blocked. If the switch's BPDU is better than the one received on a port,
        the port is in a designated state, otherwise it is in a blocked state.
