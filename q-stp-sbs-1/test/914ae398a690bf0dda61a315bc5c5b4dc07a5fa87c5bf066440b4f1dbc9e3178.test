    - The port 1 is not root. All ports on the root switch are in the designated state.
        For the other switches, the port with the best incoming BPDU is in a root
        state. The other ports are either designated or blocked. If the switch's BPDU
        is better than the one received on a port, the port is in a designated state,
        otherwise it is in a blocked state.
    q9:
