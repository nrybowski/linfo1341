    - The port 1 is not root; The port 2 is not blocked. All ports on the root switch
        are in the designated state. For the other switches, the port with the best
        incoming BPDU is in a root state. The other ports are either designated or
        blocked. If the switch's BPDU is better than the one received on a port, the
        port is in a designated state, otherwise it is in a blocked state.
